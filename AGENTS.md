# AGENTS.md - The Hub

This is the entry point. Read the Constitution first

## Quick Start

1. Read the Constitution: .specify/memory/constitution.md
2. Check the Current Plan: .specify/memory/plan.md

## Governance Files

- .specify/memory/constitution.md - Tech Stack, Rules, and Constraints. Never ignore this file.
- .specify/memory/plan.md - The current Task List. What we are doing right now.

## Skills

## Golden Rules

1. Always read constitution.md first - it defines what you can and cannot do
2. Check plan.md - understand the current context before acting
3. Use skills as reference - they contain battle-tested patterns

## Architecture

AGENTS.md (HUB) is the entry point that routes to:

- GOVERNANCE: constitution.md, plan.md
